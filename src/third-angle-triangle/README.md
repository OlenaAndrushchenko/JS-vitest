# Third angle of the triangle

Given two interior angles of a triangle in degrees, write a function that returns the third angle.

Note: Only tests with integers will be conducted.

## Input:
1. Angle 1: 30 - Angle 2: 60
2. Angle 1: 60 - Angle 2: 60

## Output:
1. 90
2. 60

## Requirements:
The function must be tested with Vitest.

## Test Cases:
1. Given 2 angles: 30, 60 -> Expected: 90
2. Given 2 angles: 60, 60 -> Expected: 60
3. Given 2 angles: 43, 78 -> Expected: 59
4. Given 2 angles: 10, 20 -> Expected: 150
